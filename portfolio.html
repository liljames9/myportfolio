            <p>
                I am probably one of the hardest workers on earth to be honest, I am the oldest of 6 kids so I have to set a example for them and lead them to the right direction. I have been through a lot so i learned so much from my mistakes, it made me who I am today now I live for my self to better my self and every way, im very motivated my mind is always telling me to move and keep going so thats exactly what I do. Real laid back and likes to watch & observe and learn also always aware.</p>

                <p>If your looking for new Developers reach out! I cant wait to work with new people learn from one another and build great software together!</p>
